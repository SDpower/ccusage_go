![Live Token Usage Monitor](docs/images/blocks-live-monitor.png)
*Real-time token usage monitoring with gradient progress bars*

## About

`ccusage_go` is a Go implementation of the popular [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) tool by [@ryoppippi](https://github.com/ryoppippi). This version maintains compatibility with the original TypeScript version while offering significant performance improvements and reduced memory footprint.

## Why Go Version?

### 🎯 Performance Benefits (Real-world Measurements)

#### blocks --live Real-time Monitoring Performance

| Metric | ccusage (TypeScript) | ccusage_go | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Peak Memory Usage** | ~446 MB | ~46 MB | **90% reduction** |
| **Peak CPU Usage** | 40.0% | 142% (startup only) | See note† |
| **Steady-state Memory** | ~263 MB | ~45 MB | **83% reduction** |
| **Process Count** | 3 (script+npm+node) | 2 (script+binary) | Simpler |
| **Startup Memory** | ~240 MB (Node.js) | ~10 MB | **96% reduction** |
| **Download Size** | ~1 MB* | **3.5-4 MB** compressed | See note below |
| **Runtime Required** | Node.js (~100MB) | None (single binary) | **No runtime needed** |

*Test environment: macOS, Apple Silicon, monitoring 10+ projects, 15-second measurements after 5s warmup*
†CPU: Go version has higher peak during initial file loading but drops to <10% during monitoring

**Note on Download Size**: While the ccusage npm package is only ~1 MB, it requires Node.js runtime (~100 MB) to be pre-installed. The ccusage_go binary is completely self-contained at 3.5-4 MB compressed, requiring no runtime or dependencies.

**Performance Testing**: The above measurements were obtained using our monitoring script (`docs/monitor_ccusage.sh`) which tracks all child processes including Node.js runtime. You can reproduce these tests with:
```bash
# Monitor ccusage (TypeScript version)
./docs/monitor_ccusage.sh

# Monitor ccusage_go
./docs/monitor_ccusage.sh ccusage_go
```

#### Other Performance Metrics

| Metric | TypeScript Version | Go Version | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Startup Time | ~300ms | ~50ms | **6x faster** |
| Resource Footprint | Node process + npm packages | Single binary | Cleaner |
| System Impact | Moderate | Minimal | Almost no system impact |

### 📦 Distribution Advantages

- **Ultra-Compact**: Only **3.5-4 MB** download (compressed)
- **Single Binary**: ~10 MB executable, no runtime required
- **Zero Dependencies**: No Node.js, npm, or any other dependencies
- **Instant Start**: Direct execution without installation process
- **Cross-Platform**: Native binaries for all major platforms

## Why Choose ccusage_go?

### 💾 Storage & Runtime Comparison

| Aspect | ccusage (TypeScript) | ccusage_go |
|--------|---------------------|------------|
| **Package Download** | ~1 MB (npm package) | **3.5-4 MB** (compressed binary) |
| **Runtime Requirement** | Node.js (~100 MB) | **None** |
| **Total Storage Need** | ~101 MB (Node.js + package) | **~10 MB** (single binary) |
| **Dependencies** | npm packages + Node.js runtime | **Zero dependencies** |
| **Update Process** | npm update (network required) | Replace single file |

### 🚀 Real-World Performance Impact

| Scenario | ccusage (TypeScript) | ccusage_go |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| **Fresh Install** | Install Node.js + npm install | Download & run |
| **Memory at Startup** | ~240 MB (Node.js init) | ~10 MB |
| **Memory at Peak** | ~419 MB | ~54 MB |
| **CPU Usage (live mode)** | 120.3% (multi-core) | 9.8% |
| **System Impact** | Noticeable | Minimal |

*While ccusage's npm package is smaller (1 MB), it requires Node.js runtime. The ccusage_go provides a complete solution in a single 3.5-4 MB download with **87% less memory usage** and **92% less CPU usage** during operation.*

## Performance Tips

1. **Large Datasets**: The Go version uses streaming and parallel processing for optimal performance
2. **Memory Optimization**: Implements smart file filtering, only loading projects active within 12 hours
3. **Live Monitoring**: Gradient calculations are cached for smooth real-time updates
4. **Resource Usage**: blocks --live mode uses only ~54MB memory with minimal system impact
5. **Incremental Cache**: Project-level caching in live mode reduces CPU usage by 68% when data is unchanged
