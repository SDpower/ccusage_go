- Binary size optimization with `-ldflags="-s -w"` (14MB ‚Üí 9.6MB)
- Unified naming convention: all binaries now use `ccusage_go` prefix
- Simplified deployment with zero runtime dependencies

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Core Optimizations
- Changed default `maxWorkers` from 5 to 1 for lower CPU usage
- Implemented progressive memory release during file processing
